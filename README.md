Beginner-Projects
=================

These are my first programs. 

I started to learn to code a little over a year ago. My first stop was codeacademy.com; you can view my profile here: http://www.codecademy.com/belozi. At Code Academy, I started with with HTML and CSS. That was pretty simple and straight forward. After that, I moved on to JavaScript which I've done multiple times, and JQuery. When I was confortable with the material for JavaScript on Code Academy, I'm moved on the try out Ruby, and then Python. At the time I was felt like all of the languages were pretty similar and, to be honest, I was a little burned out on the repetition.  Anyway, I didn't end up finishing either. 

About a year later, after working as a Marketing Consultant, I decided that I enjoy programming and find that much more interesting and challenging than working in a cubicle and managing accounts. I'm positive that Marketing is a much more interesting field at a higher level or in a different than I was working at, but for me, I would much rather apply my marketing skills and talents toward coding and creating things. So here I am...

I've have gone back to Code Academy, finished the Ruby exercises, and reworked the python excercises that I started and completed the projects after each section that I had never attempted. I decided to focus on Ruby for now and move onto Python, once I'm comfortable with Ruby. To that end, I am at the end of The Book of Ruby, and I am doing other online tutorials on Ruby and Ruby on Rails. 

This is my first folder where I will be keepping my first programs. My programming blog is located here: http://belozi360.blogspot.com/
