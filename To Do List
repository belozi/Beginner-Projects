This will be my first project.  
The goal is to make a user friendly calender/scheduler/to-do-list app.
I chose this project because I think that it is the best way to practice
and incorporate what I've learned so far into something that I, personally, 
can use.

 This code should be the intial experience that prints the to do list for the day to the console and
 and asks for user in put to update the things to do database.
